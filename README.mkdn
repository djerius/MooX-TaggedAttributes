# NAME

MooX::TaggedAttributes - Add a tag with an arbitrary value to a an attribute

# VERSION

version 0.03

# SYNOPSIS

    # Create a Role used to apply the attributes
    package Tags;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => [ qw( t1 t2 ) ];

    # Apply the role directly to a class
    package C1;
    use Tags;

    has c1 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 1 );

    my $obj = C1->new;

    # get the value of the tag t1, applied to attribute a1
    $obj->_tags->{t1}{a1};

    # Apply the tags to a role
    package R1;
    use Tag1;

    has r1 => ( is => 'ro', t2 => 2 );

    # Use that role in a class
    package C2;
    use R1;

    has c2 => ( is => 'ro', t2 => sub { }  );

    # get the value of the tag t2, applied to attribute c2
    C2->new->_tags->{t2}{c2};

# DESCRIPTION

This module attaches a tag-value pair to an attribute in a **Moo**
class or role, and provides a interface to query which attributes have
which tags, and what the values are.

## Tagging Attributes

To define a set of tags, create a special _tag role_:

    package T1;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => [ 't1' ];

    has a1 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

If there's only one tag, it can be passed directly without being
wrapped in an array:

    package T2;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => 't2';

    has a2 => ( is => 'ro', t2 => 'bar' );

A tag role is a standard **Moo::Role** with added machinery to track
attribute tags.  As shown, attributes may be tagged in the tag role
as well as in modules which consume it.

Tag roles may be consumed just as ordinary roles, but in order for
role consumers to have the ability to assign tags to attributes, they
need to be consumed with the Perl **use** statement, not with the **with** statement.

Consuming with the **with** statement _will_ propagate attributes with
existing tags, but won't provide the ability to tag new attributes.

This is correct:

    package R2;
    use Moo::Role;
    use T1;

    has r2 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

    package R3;
    use Moo::Role;
    use R3;

    has r3 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

The same goes for classes:

    package C2;
    use Moo;
    use T1;

    has c2 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo' );

Combining tag roles is as simple as **use**'ing them in the new role:

    package T12;
    use T1;
    use T2;

    package C2;
    use Moo;
    use T12;

    has c2 => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 'foo', t2 => 'bar' );

## Accessing tags

Classes and objects are provided a **\_tags** method which returns a
hash of hashes keyed off of the tags and attribute names.  For
example, for the following code:

    package T;
    use Moo::Role;
    use MooX::TaggedAttributes -tags => [ qw( t1 t2 ) ];

    package C;
    use Moo;
    use T;

    has a => ( is => 'ro', t1 => 2 );
    has b => ( is => 'ro', t2 => 'foo' );

The tag structure returned by either of the following

    C->_tags
    C->new->_tags

looks like

    { t1 => { a => 2 },
      t2 => { b => 'foo' },
    }

# BUGS AND LIMITATIONS

## Changes to an object after instantiation are not tracked.

If a role with tagged attributes is applied to an object, the
tags for those attributes are not visible.
