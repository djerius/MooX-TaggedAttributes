  [ ENHANCEMENT ]

    * _tags is now a class as well as object method

0.00_01	2015-01-12T14:34:17-0500

  [ BUG FIX ]

    * Changes to classes or role would be reflected in existing
      instantiated objects due to lazy assembly of the tags.  Tags
      are now assembled at object instantiation.

  [ BUG INTRODUCTION ]

    * Tags on attributes in roles applied to an existing object are
      not visible.

  [ BUILD FIX ]

    * Generate proper module dependencies in CPAN meta files
